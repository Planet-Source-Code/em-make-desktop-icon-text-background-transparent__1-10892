### Description

Ever wanted to make the butt ugly block of colour behind desktop icon's text disappear through code? well, now you can! I searched the net hi and low for VB code to do this but to no avail, so I wrote this. To my knowledge it's the FIRST EVER VB code for this, so check it out. It's only been tested on Win 9x & Win ME. Take a peek at my site at http://www.em.f2s.com if you like this code. Hope you learn something =)
